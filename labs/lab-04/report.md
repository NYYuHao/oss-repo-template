# Licensing

The four freedoms required for a program to be free are:

0. The freedom to run the program as wished, for any purpose
1. The freedom to study how the program works and make changes as wished (requires that the source code is accessible)
2. The freedom to redistribute copies
3. The freedom to distribute copies of modified versions to others

Licenses are important for open source software since they provide a legal declaration that the program is freely usable, modifiable, and sharable. There are several licenses that are approved by OSI, and have different terms and conditions that may apply more to some projects than others [(OSI)](https://opensource.org/licenses). The ability to choose the license lets developers legally define how their programs can be used in various ways depending on the project.

Conversely, projects that do not have licenses should not be used. Without an OSI approved license, software should not be labeled "Open Source" [(Patrick Masson, Slide 19)](https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-4470-OpenSource/blob/master/Modules/04.Licensing/Licensing-S2021-RPI-PatrickMasson.pdf). By default, a creative work is under exclusive copyright by default, which suggests that nobody can copy, distribute or modify the work even if the code is openly viewable [(Choose A License)](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/). If you use a project without a license, you risk putting yourself in legal trouble as a result.

# [Gopher](https://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain)

The paper claims that the development team for the Web beat out Gopher because Gopher didn't allow for open-source development. Having more developers and minds working on a project sped up the development of the web early on. Gopher developers splintered in development instead of standardizing an approach, where the web had a larger development communiity deciding what would be considered "right". I agree that the development of Gopher would likely have been significantly more successful had they followed an open model and allowed the community to aid in decision-making.

# Linux Licensing

Linux is licensed with GPLv2, which is a copyleft license. Linux is a highly redistributed program which comes in many different distributions. One of the reasons version 2 is specifically used is because [Linus Torvalds dislikes v3 and won't use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaKIZ7gJlRU), meaning the whole kernel can't be released under v3.
