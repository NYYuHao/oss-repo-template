# #2 Readings
#### [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd)
It is necessary to have a full-fledged definition of the term "open-source" so that its use implies the same meaning throughout. Many of the criterion provided encourage accessibility (free redistribution, no discrimination, etc.) so anyone can access and edit source code without limitation. This definition embeds accessibility and free use into the meaning of the term.

#### [Smart Questions - How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
Suggestions:
1. Provide specific examples when answering - From personal experience, reading through example snippets of code have helped me learn how to apply the answers to my personal problem. It's especially helpful when the code snippet is well commented.
2. Provide a resource to learn more from - I've personally found a lot of very helpful information in youtube videos or written guides pointed out by people answering questions. Showing people how you learned to solve the problem can help bring them down the same path.

#### Free Culture
Chapter 3 exemplifies that well intentioned developers can be relentlessly targetted by huge companies. Jesse had no intention of listing music files on the search engine but was labelled as a pirate anyways. The American legal system unfortunately doesn't support those people like Jesse, so it is really easy to get put in situations that are unwinnable. Companies might declare morality as rationale for pursuing lawsuits despite taking life savings from students. Jesse's story is a cautionary tale that shows that it's sometimes necessary to be incredibly careful about what programs we make and what systems we build. This is particularly important when projects reach the scale of Jesse's search engine (>1 million files) and potentially put profit at risk for certain groups. Fortunately for Jesse, the community recognized how evil RIAA acted and was able to raise the money he lost back ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phynd)). Certain protections need to be legally defined to prevent cases like Jesse's in the future.

Move forward on every step. Turn left if possible and only turn right if left and forward are impossible. If you hit a wall turn around fully.

# #6 Reflection
Some interesting open source projects:
* [Blokada](https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada) - Adblocker for mobile devices
* [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) - Game engine
* [Shotcut](https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut) - Video editor
* [Spreadsheet](https://github.com/audreyt/500lines/tree/master/spreadsheet) - Online spreadsheet editor

There are tons of different open source programs I use on a daily basis (Linux, Firefox, some of the above projects), many of which are certainly worthy of evaluation especially given their scale (or their smallness, like the 99line spreadsheet program).
The first problem that comes to mind is real-life task management. I often leave really disorganized notes to keep track of assignments or work I need to do, and they tend to be scattered throughout my desktop or phone without any real centralization. The calendar and task apps I do use tend to have weird quirks or end up taking a while to use, so it would be great to have something fully customizable built for this purpose.
Priority would probably go to getting a list of tasks working and then maybe expand to calendars and centralization across devices.
