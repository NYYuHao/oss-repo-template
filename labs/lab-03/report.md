![Poll Buddy GitStats](./images/gitstats-pollbuddy.png)

GitStats shows that the project has 27,772 lines of code in total and 35 authors. I’m guessing the difference in lines of code is because GitStats probably does not include non-code files like READMEs. Activity mostly stopped about 2 months ago (9 weeks) but has picked up slowly within the past week. This explains the most recent commit happening on February 9th in the email-system branch. A large portion of the commits happen at 16:00 and on Tuesdays/Fridays, which makes sense since this is when RCOS is ongoing.

![Poll Buddy Gource](./images/gource-pollbuddy.png)

Gource is a really interesting visualizer for a project. Changes for Poll Buddy appear to happen in bursts which is probably because of pull requests adding features and because most changes are probably made during or around RCOS.
